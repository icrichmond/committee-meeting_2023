2.  What I am planning to do this upcoming year
3.  Discussion points

## Past year: academic

-   Presented at CSEE-ESA (Ch 1)
-   Ran a 4 month field season in Montréal (Ch 2)
    -   Mentored two undergraduates, one honours + one Mitacs intern
-   Completed data collection and cleaning for chapter 1
-   Switched projects for ch 3 + planned (planning) a field season
-   Did my first two peer reviews, with Carly
-   Completed my course requirement

## Past year: side projects

-   Submitted two papers (BSc work)

-   Assisted Victoria Jepson (PhD, INRS) with field work, administering surveys in Ville Saint-Laurent

-   Started collaborating on a national project (UQAM/UBC/UofT/Concordia) to assess residents' perceptions of urban trees

    -   Using the data from this project to write a separate paper with Hiên's team and Carly

## Past year: teaching

-   Currently TAing with Carly as part of the "Infusing Black Scholarship" pilot program

-   Completed two guest lectures

-   Completed the Graduate Seminar in Teaching offered by CTL

## Past year: outreach

-   Regular Skype-a-Scientist meetings around the world

-   Delivered a tree identification workshop to Sinclar Laird Elementary School (Parc-Ex)

-   Did an interview with Carly for Radio-Canada on urban heat islands

-   Concordia's 4th space interview with Carly

## Past year: service

-   Graduate student mentor for the biology department

-   Graduate student representative for the Council of the School of Graduate Studies & Steering Committee

-   Graduate student representative for the Concordia Student Tribunal Pool

-   Graduate student representative for the Concordia Graduate Curriculum Committee

## Upcoming year

-   Poster presentation at CSEE (Ch 1)

-   Deploying temperature sensors for Ch 2 temperature data this summer

-   Executing a field season for Ch 3 with UdeM and UQAM teams in Montreal and Trois-Rivières

-   Submitting Ch 2 to a special issue this fall

-   & progress on all side projects and Ch 1 (of course!)

## Chapter 3: updates

Previous research question: what are the legacy effects of past urban form decisions and how do they interact with gentrification to influence the urban forest composition in current neighbourhoods?

-   proposed during my comps

-   have switched the project to be contributing to a larger grant/collaboration between Hiên, Carly, and Danielle Dagenais (UdeM)

## Chapter 3: collaboration

Les objectifs du projet:

1\) Inventorier et cartographier les infrastructures vertes déployées depuis 2000 dans les municipalités du Québec ;

**2) Examiner la fourniture des bénéfices écologiques des infrastructures vertes à Montréal et Trois-Rivières utilisant les mesures de la chaleur, de la structure de la végétation, de la biodiversité et d'autres caractéristiques physiques ;**

3\) Évaluer les impacts sociaux des infrastructures vertes à Montréal et Trois Rivières à travers la perception, l'expérience et l'engagement de la population locale envers ces infrastructures

## Chapter 3: ecological benefits

-   Our team's responsibility to assess the *ecological benefits* of green infrastructure in Montreal + Trois-Rivières

-   Green infrastructure = ruelles vertes + sidewalk gardens

-   Ecological benefits:

    -   heat mitigation (ruelles only)

    -   habitat connectivity

    -   habitat provisioning

    -   stormwater mitigation

## Chapter 3: habitat provisioning

-   Assess 40 (?) ruelles vertes and adjacent street boulevards/gardens in Villeray-Saint Michael-Parc Extension & Trois-Rivières

-   Habitat provisioning - efficient but meaningful?

    -   Vegetative complexity

    -   \% cover of graminoids vs non-graminoids

    -   3 most dominant flowering plant species

    -   Tree species + size for all trees present

    -   Canopy cover

## Chapter 3: site selection

-   my project wants to assess how ecological benefits, social perceptions, and gentrification all interact

-   how to choose sites to make sure I have enough of a gradient for each of these variables?
